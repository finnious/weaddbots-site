                    <h3>Scott Finney</h3>
                    <p class="founder-role">Founder, WeAddBots</p>
                    <p>I've spent 15+ years in SEO and digital marketing — helping businesses figure out how to get found online, convert visitors into customers, and make sense of tools that are supposed to make life easier but often don't.</p>
                    <p>A few years ago, AI changed everything. Not the hype-cycle AI you see on LinkedIn — the practical kind. The kind that can read an email and draft a response. Route a lead to the right person in seconds. Turn a 2.5-hour inventory task into a 4-minute one. That's the AI I got obsessed with.</p>
                    <p>So I started WeAddBots to bring that to Memphis businesses. Not the businesses with IT departments and six-figure tech budgets — the restaurants, service companies, retail shops, and professional firms that make this city run. The ones where the owner is still answering emails at 11pm because there's nobody else to do it.</p>
                    <p>If that sounds like you, I'd love to talk.</p>

No pitch, no upsell — just local business owners sharing what's working, asking questions, and figuring this stuff out together. It's the best hour you'll spend on AI all week.</p>

                        <p>Don't wait for the perfect AI strategy. Start with one automation that removes one friction point. Learn from it. Build from there. The businesses winning with AI right now didn't start with a master plan — they started with a first step.</p>

                        <h4>Humans in the Loop</h4>
                        <p>AI is a tool, not a replacement. The best automations keep humans where they matter most — making decisions, building relationships, doing creative work — and let AI handle the repetitive stuff. More humans doing human work, not fewer humans doing more.</p>

            <h2 class="mb-24">Quick Context: How We Actually Work</h2>
            <p>Every engagement starts the same way: a conversation. We learn about your business, your tools, your team, and — most importantly — the specific friction points that drive you crazy every day. No 40-page discovery documents. No death-by-PowerPoint.</p>
            <p>From there, we map the simplest automation that solves the biggest problem first. We build it, test it, walk you through it, and make sure you understand exactly how it works. Then we ask: what's the next friction point?</p>
            <p>That's it. No retainers unless results warrant it. No ongoing fees for the sake of ongoing fees. Just practical wins that compound over time.</p>
