                    <h3>Scott Finney</h3>
                    <p class="founder-role">Founder, WeAddBots</p>
                    <p>Here's what I keep thinking about: for the first time ever, the business you built is no longer limited by the resources you wished you had.</p>
                    <p>Think about that for a second. Every small business owner I've ever met has a version of the same story &mdash; "If I just had one more person to handle the follow-ups." "If I just had someone to keep the books straight while I focus on clients." "If I could afford a marketing team." The answer was always the same: you can't. Not yet. Not at your size.</p>
                    <p>AI changed that. Not in a hype-cycle, buzzword-bingo kind of way. In a real, practical, right-now kind of way. You now have access to an unlimited number of skilled team members ready to be given direction on how to help your business achieve its goals. They work 24 hours a day. They don't call in sick. They cost a fraction of what you'd pay a human &mdash; and for a lot of tasks, they're just as good or better.</p>
                    <p>I spent 10+ years as a software engineer, building systems and solving problems with code. A few years ago, AI tools crossed a threshold that made me stop everything else. Because I realized: this isn't just another tech trend. This is the great equalizer. The same capabilities that Fortune 500 companies spend millions on are now accessible to a service company in Collierville, a professional firm in East Memphis, a retail shop in Bartlett.</p>
                    <p>That's why I started WeAddBots. To help Memphis business owners take advantage of this moment &mdash; practically, without the hype, and without ripping out what's already working.</p>
                    <p>A mindset I'll leave you with: <strong>What would you do if you had an army of 10,000 of the smartest people you've ever known willing to work for you 24 hours a day &mdash; what would you have them work on?</strong></p>
                    <p>That's the question. And it's a real one now.</p>

                    <p>You don't need new software. You don't need an IT department. The CRM you already use, the email you already check, the spreadsheets you already maintain &mdash; AI plugs into all of it. We just make those tools smarter and connect the gaps between them.</p>

                    <p>The best use of AI isn't replacing people &mdash; it's freeing them. When AI handles the repetitive data entry, the routine follow-ups, the copy-pasting between systems &mdash; your people get to do the work that actually requires a human. The relationship building, the creative thinking, the problem solving.</p>

            <p>Every engagement starts the same way: a conversation. We learn about your business, your tools, your team, and &mdash; most importantly &mdash; the specific friction points that drive you crazy every day. No 40-page discovery documents. No death-by-PowerPoint.</p>
            <p>From there, we map the simplest automation that solves the biggest problem first. We build it, test it, walk you through it, and make sure you understand exactly how it works. Then we ask: what's the next friction point?</p>
            <p>That's it. No retainers unless results warrant it. No ongoing fees for the sake of ongoing fees. Just practical wins that compound over time.</p>
