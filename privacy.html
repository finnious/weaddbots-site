    <h2 style="font-size:1.3rem; margin-top:40px; margin-bottom:12px;">The Type of Information We Collect from You</h2>

Our website automatically records this basic information about you.</p>
    <p>And like many other websites, we may use cookies. In plain English, this means information that our website's server transfers to your computer. This information can be used to track your session on our website. Cookies may also be used to customize our website content for you as an individual. If you are using one of the common Internet web browsers, you can set up your browser to either let you know when you receive a cookie or to deny cookie access to your computer.</p>
