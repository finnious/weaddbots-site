The automation platforms we use (Zapier, Google Apps Script, webhooks) connect to thousands of apps. If your tool has an integration or API, it can almost certainly be connected.</p>

                        <p>Here's the thing &mdash; most business owners know AI could probably help, but they don't know <em>where</em> to start. The assessment is designed to answer that question. You tell us about your daily operations &mdash; the repetitive tasks, the bottlenecks, the things that fall through cracks. We'll identify the highest-impact spots where simple automation could make an immediate difference. No jargon, no upsell. If AI isn't the right fit for what you need, we'll tell you that too.</p>
