            <p><strong>Rebecca is an AI-powered receptionist that handles your inbound calls, gathers the information you need, qualifies leads, filters spam, and routes real opportunities to the right person &mdash; so nothing falls through the cracks.</strong> She works 24 hours a day, never calls in sick, and costs a fraction of a full-time hire. Setup takes 30 minutes. She can be answering your phone the same day.</p>
            <p>Here's the thing: every business owner has the same story. A qualified lead calls at 2pm while you're in a meeting. A potential client reaches out after hours and gets voicemail. A spam caller eats 10 minutes of your day that you'll never get back. Rebecca solves all three problems at once &mdash; and she gives you a weekly report so you always know what's happening on your phone lines.</p>
