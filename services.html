            <p><strong>WeAddBots provides AI automation consulting for established Memphis businesses — service companies, retail shops, professional firms, and more.</strong> We identify the specific repetitive tasks, slow processes, and missed opportunities costing you the most time and money, then build lightweight automations that fix them. Everything layers on top of your existing tools. Your first working automation is typically live within a week or two.</p>

            <div class="answer-block">
                <p><strong>AI-powered lead response automation engages every inquiry within 60 seconds — 24 hours a day, 7 days a week — so you never lose a lead to slow follow-up again.</strong> The automation reads incoming messages, sends a personalized response, asks qualifying questions, and routes the lead to the right person or system.</p>
                <p>Quick example: an equipment sales company gets 20+ online inquiries per week — specs requests, financing questions, availability checks. Without automation, about 40% go unanswered within the first hour, especially during busy seasons or after hours. With a simple AI response workflow, every inquiry gets a personalized reply in under 60 seconds, financing questions get flagged for the sales team, and availability checks pull from the current inventory system automatically.</p>
                <p>The result? Fewer missed opportunities, faster deals, and a sales team that can focus on closing instead of triaging inboxes.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">What Repetitive Tasks Can AI Automate for My Business?</h2>

            <div class="answer-block">
                <p><strong>Almost any task you do the same way more than twice a week can be automated — data entry, invoice follow-ups, report generation, copy-pasting between tools, and manual notifications.</strong> We identify the tasks draining the most time from your team, then build automations that handle them in the background while you focus on work that actually grows the business.</p>
                <p>Here's the thing: most business owners don't realize how much time they're spending on these tasks until someone maps them out. One client was spending 2.5 hours every week on an inventory management process — manually pulling data from one system, reformatting it, and entering it into another. We built an automation that does the same thing in 4 minutes. Same accuracy, same result, fraction of the time.</p>
                <p>That's not a moonshot AI project. That's a practical automation built on tools you probably already use.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="accent-card mt-32 max-w-3xl">
                <p><strong>Common tasks we automate:</strong> appointment reminders and confirmations, invoice follow-ups, report generation from multiple data sources, data syncing between CRM and spreadsheets, social media scheduling, customer feedback collection, new employee onboarding checklists, and recurring email sequences.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">How Do I Connect My Business Tools Without Replacing Them?</h2>

            <div class="answer-block">
                <p><strong>Smart workflow automation connects the tools you already use — CRM, email, scheduling, accounting, spreadsheets — so information flows automatically between them without manual transfers or duplicate entry.</strong> We build the bridges between your systems. You keep everything you trust.</p>
                <p>Most Memphis businesses we work with already have great tools. The problem isn't the tools — it's that they don't talk to each other. A new lead comes in through the website form, but someone has to manually add them to the CRM. An invoice gets paid, but the accounting spreadsheet doesn't update until someone remembers to do it. A meeting gets booked, but the prep notes don't get pulled together until the last minute.</p>
                <p>Each of those gaps is a workflow automation waiting to happen. We connect the dots — not by replacing anything, but by adding a smart layer that handles the handoffs automatically.</p>

            <h2 class="mb-24">What We Don't Do</h2>
            <p>Transparency builds trust, so here's what's out of scope:</p>
            <p><strong>We don't sell software.</strong> We build automations on platforms you already use or that are free/affordable. If we disappear tomorrow, your automations keep running.</p>
            <p><strong>We don't do months-long "digital transformations."</strong> If someone promises to "revolutionize your operational workflows," run. We deliver practical wins in a week or two, then build from there.</p>
            <p><strong>We don't overpromise.</strong> AI is powerful, but it's not magic. We'll tell you what it can do for your business today — and what it can't yet. Garbage in, garbage out still applies.</p>
            <p><strong>We don't work with everyone.</strong> We're selective about engagements because results matter more than revenue. If your project isn't a good fit, we'll tell you — and we'll point you in a better direction if we can.</p>
