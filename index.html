    <p><strong>WeAddBots helps established Memphis businesses cut through AI hype and find the automations that actually matter.</strong> Founded by <a href="/about">Scott Finney</a>, we work with service companies, retail shops, professional firms, and other businesses that are already generating consistent activity — but drowning in repetitive tasks, missed follow-ups, slow lead responses, and manual chaos.</p>
    <p>Here's the thing: you don't need a six-month digital transformation. You don't need to rip out your current systems. You need someone who understands your business, identifies the biggest friction points, and layers smart, lightweight automations on top of what's already working. That's what we do. Your first wins typically show up in a week or two — not months.</p>

<!-- What We Do — Services Overview -->
<section class="section bg-gray-50">

    <p class="section-label">What We Do</p>
    <h2 class="section-title">Three Ways We Remove the Friction</h2>
    <p class="section-subtitle">Every engagement starts with understanding your specific bottlenecks — then building the simplest automation that solves them.</p>
    <div class="card-grid">
      <div class="card">
        <div class="card-icon">&#9889;</div>
        <h3>Lead Response Automation</h3>
        <p>Your business gets inquiries at 2am, on weekends, and during your busiest hours. AI-powered instant responses engage every lead within 60 seconds, qualify them with the right questions, and route them where they need to go.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mt-16">You don't need to manually respond to every lead anymore.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <div class="card-icon">&#9881;</div>
        <h3>Task Automation</h3>
        <p>That spreadsheet you update every Monday morning. The invoice follow-ups you forget about. The data you copy-paste between three different tools. We identify the repetitive tasks draining your team's time and automate them — so you can focus on the work that actually grows your business.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mt-16">One client went from 2.5 hours of inventory work to 4 minutes.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <div class="card-icon">&#128279;</div>
        <h3>Smart Workflows</h3>
        <p>Most businesses already use great tools — CRMs, Google Workspace, accounting software, scheduling platforms. The problem is they don't talk to each other. We connect your existing tools with intelligent automation so information flows where it needs to, when it needs to. A rip-and-replace is rarely the first step.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mt-16">Keep what works. Connect what doesn't.</p>

        <div class="card-icon mx-auto">&#128295;</div>
        <h3>Keep What Works</h3>
        <p>We layer automations on top of your existing systems. Your CRM, your spreadsheets, your email — they stay. We just make them smarter.</p>
